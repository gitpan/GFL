Description
-----------
This archive contains two Perl modules :

GFL - a low-level SWIG wrapper for P-e Gougelet's cross platform
Graphic File Library.

GFL::Image - a full-fledged object oriented interface to the above.

GFL's main strength is it's ability to read more than 300 image formats and
to write around 50. It also contains a large set of filters and
image manipulation tools.
It is free for non-commercial use.
